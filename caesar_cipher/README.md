# PRODIGY_CS_01
A Python program that encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.
Caesar Cipher
A simple Python program to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.
Features
✅ Encrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher
✅ Decrypt messages back to plaintext
✅ User-defined shift values
✅ Simple and interactive CLI
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the message forward or backward in the alphabet by a fixed number of places (the shift value).

  Encryption: Moves letters forward by the shift value.
  Decryption: Moves letters backward by the shift value.

LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE 

  Encryption (Shift Right by 3)

  HACK → KDFN

Decryption (Shift Left by 3)

   EZXH → HACK


HOW TO USE!
1: Run the script => python caesar_cipher.py

2: Choose an option
The script asks whether you want to encrypt or decrypt:

    Type e for encryption.
    Type d for decryption.
    
3: Provide a key (shift value)

    Enter a number between 1 and 26
    The key determines how much each letter will shift in the alphabet.

4: Enter the text

    If encrypting, type the plaintext (e.g., yatch).
    If decrypting, type the ciphertext to reveal the original message.

5: Get the result

    The script will output the encrypted or decrypted text.
    ENCRYPTED!: text
    DECRYPTED!: text
    
    
    
    in conclusion: 
    This script lets users encrypt or decrypt messages using a Caesar cipher. Users provide a shift key, and the script applies the transformation. It is useful for basic cryptography demonstrations or simple message obfuscation.
